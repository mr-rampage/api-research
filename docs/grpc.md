# gRPC

## Summary

> gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross- platform client and server bindings for many languages. â€” wikipedia

The main use case is for machine- to-machine communication. Google is currently migrating all their internal microservices to communicate via gRPC because the protocol provides a uniform interface for defining authentication and load balancing. As well, it also is more efficient communication protocol compared to REST. There is support for mobile and the web, however, these use cases are not as widely used. It supports both request-response and streaming style communication.

## Design Strategy

- Define types and procedures
- Define service methods
- Create service definition
- Incorporate into build

## Tech Stack

## Challenges

- Using Vert.x, Kotlin, gRPC
  - Vert.x only works with version 1.25.0 of the gRPC. Any version higher would not compile.
  - Java 8+ would require a dependency to "javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.2".
